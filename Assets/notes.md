Helpful Hints from Anthony
* setInterval for the timer

* clearInterval to stop the timeout

* VAR currentScore/timeLeft.

* VAR questions -Array

* VAR pointer/idex - Current position in the question array

```
var questions = [ 
    {
    "what is your favorite color?"
    // Questions text
    // List of question choices
    // Correct Answer
    }
]
```
